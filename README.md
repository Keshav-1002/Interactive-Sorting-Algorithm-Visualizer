Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:
This is an interactive Python application built with Tkinter that vividly demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. It's a great tool for anyone looking to understand sorting mechanics through dynamic visualization. Just input your own data, select an algorithm, and watch the process unfold in real-time.

Features:
Intuitive Input: Easily enter the number of elements and their values using a straightforward interface.
Diverse Algorithms: Explore and compare common sorting methods:
    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    Quick Sort
    Merge Sort
    Count Sort

Algorithm Insights: Displays the time complexity of the selected sorting algorithm, offering deeper understanding into its efficiency.

Real-time Visualization: See elements being compared and swapped dynamically. Bars representing data change color to highlight current operations, making complex steps easy to follow.

Adjustable Playback Speed: Control the animation pace, allowing you to slow down complex parts for detailed understanding or speed through familiar sections.

Engaging Audio Feedback: Subtle sound cues enhance usability, indicating successful inputs, errors, and general button interactions.

Quick Reset: Reset the entire visualization at any time to experiment with new datasets and algorithms.
